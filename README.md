# Game-Of-Life

This is not the usual Game Of Life that we play with family memebers when we have free time. The Game of Life or called 
"cellular automaton" was created by mathematician John Horton Conway in 1970. The rules are simple.

Rules to the Game:

* Each cell interacts with its 8 neighbors
* If a cell is alive, it remains alive if it has 2 or 3 live neighbors
* If a cell is alive and has fewer than 2 or more than 3 live neighbors, it dies
* If a cell is dead, it comes to life only if it has exactly 3 live neighbors

This simulator emuates the game's rules on a grid and creates amazing patterns.
